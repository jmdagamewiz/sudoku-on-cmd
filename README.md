Hello! This program was made by John Mark David L. Pintor, a Filipino student in the 12th Grade.

I made this program just out of my whim. What if there was a game you could play in the command prompt of

exactly what I wanted to make.

To anyone who's reading this, thank you for downloading my game. I hope you share it with your friends and
family. Learning about technology isn't as hard as people tell it to be. I hope that as you play this game, 
you'll realize that this thing I've made really isn't as complicated as people think it is.
